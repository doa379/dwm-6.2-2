This is dwm-6.2 with systray patch, plus other enhancements. This fork anticipates 
being close to vanilla-dwm as much as possible. The only other elaborate patch is the 
systray patch which is taken from the suckless website.

There are a number of key enhancements that facilitate improvements to the usage 
criteria of dwm as a daily driver. By default dwm now uses the floating layout across
the entire program. Tiling and maximisation is now a manual action through the usual 
Mod+t/m keymaps. However tiling features are performed semi-automatically before 
dwm reverts to floating mode. You now effectively have tiling features in a 
floating client configuration. This allows each tag to preserve its own configuration 
of clients without having to store the state of each tag independently.


dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
