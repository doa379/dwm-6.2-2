This is dwm-6.2 with systray patch, plus a number of additional enhancements to
improve usability. This fork anticipates being close to vanilla-dwm as much as
possible. The only elaborate patch is the systray patch which is taken from the
suckless website.

New Features
------------

* The floating layout is used across the entire program. Tiling and
maximization are now a manual action through the usual 
Mod+t/m keymaps. Tiling features are performed semi-automatically before
reverting to floating mode. This allows each tag to be tiled in a floating client
configuration. Hence each tag preserves its own configuration without
having to store the state of each tag independently.

* Colored statusbar. The color schemes used in dwm are hard coded in config.h
and as such dwm dynamically allocates color schemes at the outset. You can
now pass a delimiter ("|" say) in the root string and dwm will cycle through
the array of color schemes and assign a scheme to the string contained within
the delimiters. The order of the coloring will follow the ordering of the
colors defined in the array of color schemes. The overheads for this feature
have been kept to a bare minimum. It is a simple patch that introduces a
single function which tokenizes the root string.



dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
