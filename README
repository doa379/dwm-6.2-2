dwm-6.2 with systray patch, plus other enhancements. 
This project anticipates being close to vanilla-dwm as much as possible. 
The only elaborate patch is the systray patch taken from the suckless website.
The other enhancements are a series of tiny improvements, and are largely to the functionality and usability of dwm. Vanilla-dwm is too rigid in my estimate from a usability standpoint.
For instance, dwm now sets all clients to floating behaviour by default, with tiling done upon manual and semi-automatic request. You can now have tiling features from a floating client configuration. This allows each tag to preserve its own configuration of clients without having to use any sort of (elaborate) Pertag patch. All these patches are my own. Give it a try and I hope you will see its ease of use and low overhead on patches very conducive to use.


dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
